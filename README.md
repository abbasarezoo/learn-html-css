# Learn HTML and CSS

## Learning by doing

The whole point of these tutorials is to learn how to write basic HTML markup and style it using some simple CSS to create some simple layout components. You will learn what certain HTML tags and CSS properties are as you go, why they are different and how to apply them.

These tutorials should be used as a foundation for further learning. Hopefully you'll explore and learn the intricacies of both HTML and CSS as you progress and feel confident enough to start building components beyond the scope of this project.

### Getting started

To get started you will need a [free Codepen account](http://www.codepen.io) and an open mind. Most people fear writing code because of its complex nature but HTML and CSS is really simple in their purist forms. And these tutorials will be simple enough for anybody to follow. Codepen allows you to write and edit code in your browser **and** see what it looks like in the same browser window. Ideal for beginners like you!

### But, but, you should learn what each HTML tag and CSS property is first!

Not really. But this way might not work for everybody, so if you'd like to delve into the full scope of attributes and elements of HTML then [this is a great place to begin](http://htmlreference.io/). If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of each CSS property then [here's a good place to start](http://cssreference.io/).

Good luck!
