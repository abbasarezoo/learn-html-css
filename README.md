# Learn HTML and CSS

## Learning by doing

Put simply, we're going to build a few components in HTML and make them look good with CSS. You will learn what certain HTML tags and CSS properties are as you go, why they are different and how to apply them.

These tutorials should be used as a foundation for further learning. Hopefully you'll explore and learn the deeper intricacies of both HTML and CSS as you progress.

The goal is for you to feel confident enough to start building layouts and components beyond the scope of this project.

### Getting started

To get started you will need a [free Codepen account](http://www.codepen.io) and an open mind. Most people fear writing code because of its complex nature, but HTML and CSS is super-simple in their purist form. And these tutorials will be simple enough for anybody to follow. 

Codepen allows you to write and edit code in your browser **and** see what it looks like in the same browser window. Ideal for beginners like you!

## But, but, you should learn what each HTML tag and CSS property is first!

Not really. But this way might not work for everybody, so if you'd like to delve into the full scope of attributes and elements of HTML then [this is a great place to begin](http://htmlreference.io/). If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of each CSS property then [here's a good place to start](http://cssreference.io/).

Good luck!

## Key points

## What is HTML?

HTML is, as Wikipedia puts it, the standard markup language (code) for creating web pages and web applications. If you open any website in your browser and right click and select "View Page Source" you will see a whole load of HTML code. Web browsers render this code on your screen as text, links, images, forms, colours etc.

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Inside a stylesheet is code that describes what HTML tags will look like when the browser renders it. Web developers generally refer to the code written inside a stylesheet as CSS.

So, you create your page layout with HTML tags and describe what the page layout looks like using CSS.

## Tutorial #1: Typesetting

In this tutorial we're going to take a bunch of simple text and format it on our page. A key thing to remember when dealing with text like paragraphs, headings and lists in HTML is to compare it to writing an email or a Word document. You write the text and then you format it using the program's rigid in-built styles.

The difference here is that we can determine our own styles and apply them to whatever we like.
