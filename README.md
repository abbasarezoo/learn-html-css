# Learn HTML and CSS

## Learning by doing

The whole point of these tutorials is learn how to write basic HTML markup and style it using simple CSS to create some simple layout components. You will learn what certain HTML tags are as you go, why they are different to other tags and how to add styles to them.

These tutorials should be used as a foundation for further learning. Hopefully you'll explore and learn the intricacies of both HTML and CSS as you progress.

### Getting started

To get started you will need a free [Codepen](http://www.codepen.io) account and an open mind. Most people fear writing code because of its complex nature but HTML and CSS is really simple in their purist forms. Codepen allows you to write and edit code in your browser **and** see what it looks like in the same browser window. Ideal for beginners like you!

### But, but, you should learn what each HTML tag and CSS property is first!

Not really, I learned by doing and it worked for me. But this way might not work for everybody so if you'd like to delve into the full scope of attributes and elements of HTML then [this is a great place to begin](http://htmlreference.io/). If you want to get into the nitty-gritty of each CSS property then [here's a good place to start](http://cssreference.io/).
