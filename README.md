# Learn HTML and CSS

## Learning by doing.

The whole point of these tutorials is learn how to write basic HTML and style it using simple CSS. You will learn what certain HTML tags are and why they are different to other tags, but we won't be spending much time on the details.

These tutorials should be used as a foundation for further learning. Hopefully you'll explore and learn the intricacies of both HTML and CSS as you progress.

## Getting started

To get started you will need a free [Codepen](www.codepen.io) account and an open mind. Most people fear writing code because of its complex nature. Codepen allows you to write and edit code in your browser **and** see what it looks like in the same browser window. Ideal for beginners like you!
